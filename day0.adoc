== So it begins... 

It's the start of a new school year and you're about to stand in front of a group of teenage students and say "This is CS50." 

You're nevrous, but on the surface you look calm and ready. image:assets/eminem.jpg[eminem, 30,40]

This page serves as a short list of things to consider to help you feel under control and have this first day go smoothly.

== Websites to Whitelist

To properly set up the CS50 student experience, be sure to have your school or district whitelist the following websites.

|===
|Programming and Debugging |Grading and Submission of Assignments |Reference and Course Materials
 
|*.edx.org
|*.github.com
|*.cs50.harvard.edu
 
|*.c9.io
|*.cs50.me
|*.cs50.net
 
|*.cs50.io
|
|*.cs50.tv
|===

The process of getting websites whitelisted may take quite some time, so best to plan on initiating a dialog with your administration at least a month before the start of the school year.
