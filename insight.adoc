Some CS50 AP teachers are lucky to have the full support from school and/or district administration. Others, not so much. For planning events, grading policies, establishing a rich culture, and ensuring access to technology, administration support is increadibly helpful. Your excitement can go a long way to sell the course. CS50 is always willing to aid in convicing administration to properly support the course. If you would like CS50 to write a letter with Harvard's letterhead to aid in your dialog with administration, feel free to email a request to ap@cs50.harvard.edu.

== Being Less Comfortable with Concepts

Not unlike many CS50 AP students, you may find yourself on the side of Less Comfortable with teaching a particular concept. This is absolutely okay! We've all been there. We at CS50 are here to help provide you with as many resources as possible. Here are some of the resources at your disposal:

== Suggested Technology

When planning for CS50 AP, it is advantageous to keep technological resources in mind. Luckily, with the CS50 IDE being cloud-based, there are very little hardware requirements for students to code and submit their work. As long as the students have a device that can access the internet via a web browser, they should be able to code on it. The choice of device will not impact how the IDE runs.  However, it is easier to code with a physical keyboard, so a more traditional computer or laptop is suggested. 

From a teaching point of view, presenting new information is much better with a wealth of technology at your disposal. The following may come in handy for creating a dynamic and enganging classroom.

.*Smart/Promethean Board*
These interactive whiteboards allow for students and teachers to interact with presentations using touch and special writing utencils.

.*Screen mirroring hardware*
Screen mirroring allows you to move your laptop, tablet, or other device being used to display information through a projector or television. This can come in handy for presentions of information on the fly and for being able to cylce around the classroom during a presentation.

TIP: A tablet being screen mirrored to a projector can work wonders for classroom management as you can cycle through the room while displaying information.

.*Classroom speakers to play media*
Music can create an engergetic, motivating, and/or focused enviorment depending on the playlist chosen.

TIP: In a pinch, a single bluetooth speaker can work wonders if the classroom does not have a speaker system.

== Process of Whitelisting Websites

link:../day0.html#_websites_to_whitelist[Whitelisting websites] is essential in order for students to take CS50 AP. Otherwise, students won't have access to the CS50 IDE and other resources.  It's best to ask administration at your school or district about this process. In some cases, it could take more than a month to have the websites approved to be whitelisted. Thus, start this process a few months out from the start of the school year. If you run into any bumps, feel free to contact us to ask for a persuasive letter at ap@cs50.harvard.edu.

== Classroom Culture

The development of CS50 culture at your school is a big part of making the course more accessible and engaging for students. During any given semester at Harvard, over 70% of the students taking CS50 have no previous programming experiece. The galvanizing culture of CS50 helps students become comfortable with taking on the challenge of learning a new concept. To help create a culture that is CS50 AP at your school, consider some of the following.

=== Showmanship

As a teacher, never be afraid to use a little showmanship. Adding your personal flare and quality production goes a long way to give your class a fun and engaging vibe. In the past, I have personally used streamers for special occasions, humor subtly-embedded into assignments, and well-timed classroom music to help enhance the classroom experience.

=== CS50 events

CS50 events are a huge part of what makes CS50 AP tick. They not only increase notoriety on campus and in the community, but they also help students feel more comfortable and excited about material that otherwise may be intimidating. We want to make sure to provide you with a link:../events.html[wealth of advice on running events at your school]. If you need any help with this process, feel free to contact ap@harvard.cs50.edu.


=== Occasional food, snacks, or treats

Food and culture go hand in hand. It can help events become more engaging. It can also take the edge off of when students feel stressed. For example, I used to give cupcakes to my students on test days.


== Establishing Community Partnerships

Community partnerships can be very nifty for implementing CS50 AP at your school. Not only can they help your brand for the course, they can become very helpful for when you plan events. You may be suprised at company connections that already exist in the local community through your students. In general, it never hurts to ask. Often asking for a donation or discount from a local company yields satisfactory results.
